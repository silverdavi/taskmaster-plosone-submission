## Overview

This repository contains the complete submission package for the manuscript **"Investigating Audience Preferences Within the Hybrid Competitive-Comedic Format of Taskmaster UK"** submitted to PLOS ONE journal.

### Abstract

This study analyzes audience engagement patterns in hybrid entertainment formats through comprehensive analysis of 18 series of Taskmaster UK, combining over 900 tasks and 32,000 IMDb ratings. Using statistical mixture modeling and machine learning approaches, we investigate how scoring dynamics, contestant attributes, and emotional tone relate to viewer perception in competitive-comedic entertainment.
